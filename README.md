# Good Old Scoreboard

A custom scoreboard for Garry's Mod.
Initially, it was designed for a cool project,
but it was quickly abandoned because of
*infinite planning hell* and internal disagreements.
After deciding, that letting the code rot was a bad
idea, I released the scoreboard to the public.

## Features

- Easy custom role setup
- Customizable background dim and blur
- Customizable size and position
- Configurable cursor auto lock
- Dynamic color system
- Translated into English, Ukrainian, Slovak, Turkish
- Build mode support ([Kyle ULX Buildmode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1308900979) and [Pika ULX Buildmode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3010826647))

Run `cvarlist cl_goscrbrd` in game console to list
all available commands and customization options.
