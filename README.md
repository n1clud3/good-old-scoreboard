# Good Old Scoreboard

A custom scoreboard for Garry's Mod.
Initially, it was designed for a cool project,
but it was quickly abandoned because of *infinite planning hell* and
internal disagreements.
After deciding, that letting the code rot was a bad idea,
I released the scoreboard to the public.

## Features

- Easy custom role setup
- Customizable background dim and blur
- Dynamic color system

Run `cvarlist cl_goscrbrd` in game console to list all available commands and customization options.
